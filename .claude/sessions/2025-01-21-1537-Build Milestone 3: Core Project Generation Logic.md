## Progress

### Tasks Started
- None yet

### Tasks Completed
- None yet

### Current Focus
- Setting up session and preparing to implement TODO.md tasks

### Notes
- TODO.md created with 25 atomic tasks totaling 40 hours
- Following TDD approach - tests before implementation
- Maintaining security focus with command sanitization
- Building cross-platform support from foundation

### Issues/Blockers
- None currently

### Next Steps
- Begin with Task S001: Create Core Module Structure
- Follow the planned sequence from TODO.md

### Update - 2025-07-21 12:47 PM

**Summary**: Completed comprehensive FileRenderer testing (Task T003) - all foundation components now fully implemented and tested

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: create_project/core/file_renderer.py (improved binary detection)
- Added: tests/unit/core/test_file_renderer.py (44 comprehensive tests)
- Current branch: milestone-3-core-generation (commit: a86cb23)

**Todo Progress**: 8 completed, 0 in progress, 1 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Task S001: Create Core Module Structure
- âœ“ Completed: Task D001: Implement Cross-Platform Path Handler  
- âœ“ Completed: Task T001: Write Unit Tests for Path Utilities
- âœ“ Completed: Task D002: Create Project Directory Structure Generator
- âœ“ Completed: Task T002: Write Unit Tests for Directory Creator
- âœ“ Completed: Task D003: Implement File Template Renderer
- âœ“ Completed: Task T003: Write Unit Tests for File Renderer
- âœ“ Completed: Updated BUILD-PLAN.md with progress tracking
- ðŸŽ¯ Next: Task D004: Create Core Project Generator Class

**Phase 1 Foundation Complete**: All three foundation components implemented with comprehensive testing:
- **PathHandler**: Cross-platform path operations with security validation (44 tests)
- **DirectoryCreator**: Recursive directory creation with rollback (35 tests) 
- **FileRenderer**: Template rendering with encoding/permissions (44 tests)

**Key Achievements This Update**:
- Fixed 3 failing FileRenderer tests (binary detection, security integration, mixed file rendering)
- Enhanced binary file detection with PNG/GIF/JPEG signatures and improved chardet confidence checking
- All 366 tests now passing (44 new FileRenderer tests + 322 existing)
- Ready to move into Phase 2: Core orchestration components

**Technical Details**:
- FileRenderer integrates seamlessly with Milestone 2 template system
- Comprehensive coverage: text/binary files, encoding detection, executable permissions
- Security validation through PathHandler prevents path traversal attacks
- Rollback mechanisms enable atomic operations with error recovery
- Progress reporting system ready for GUI integration

**Next Steps**: Begin Task D004 implementation - the ProjectGenerator class that orchestrates all foundation components into the complete project generation workflow.
