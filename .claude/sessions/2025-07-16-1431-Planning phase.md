- 2 modified files not staged

### Todo Summary
**Total Tasks**: 5 completed / 0 remaining

**Completed Tasks**:
1. ✓ Read and analyze SPEC.md to understand project requirements
2. ✓ Identify all functional requirements and features
3. ✓ Break down requirements into actionable tasks
4. ✓ Organize tasks into logical milestones
5. ✓ Create BUILD-PLAN.md with structured to-do list

**Incomplete Tasks**: None

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Comprehensive Build Plan Created**: Developed a detailed BUILD-PLAN.md with 7 milestones and 51+ specific tasks
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Thoroughly analyzed the 410-line SPEC.md to extract all functional and technical requirements
3. **Task Breakdown**: Successfully decomposed the project into actionable items with clear ownership and dependencies
4. **Clarifications Obtained**: Got answers to 10 critical questions about implementation details
5. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Incorporated future Windows/Linux support into the plan

### Features Planned
- PyQt-based wizard interface with 5 steps
- 6 built-in project templates (one-off script, CLI apps, Django, Flask, Python library)
- YAML-based template system with variable substitution
- Ollama AI integration for error assistance
- Git repository initialization
- Virtual environment creation
- License text management system
- Progress reporting and threading model
- PyPI distribution and PyInstaller executable

### Important Findings
1. **Python Version**: Minimum requirement set to Python 3.9.6
2. **Ollama Integration**: Will auto-detect installation and enumerate models
3. **License Management**: Full license texts will be included (not just references)
4. **Template Validation**: Strict validation with errors (no warnings)
5. **Template Format**: YAML format for sharing templates
6. **Localization**: English-only for initial release
7. **No Features**: No analytics, auto-update, or IDE integration

### Configuration Requirements Identified
- `pyproject.toml` for dependencies
- `settings.json` for user preferences
- `.env` for environment configuration
- Logging via existing `logger.py` module
- Cache directory for Ollama responses

### Risk Factors Identified
1. PyQt licensing compliance
2. Ollama availability handling
3. Template security (injection attacks)
4. Cross-platform path handling
5. Performance with large projects
6. Qt5 vs Qt6 compatibility

### Estimated Timeline
- Total Duration: 12 weeks
- Largest effort: UI Implementation (3 weeks)
- Critical path: Template System → Core Logic → UI → Integration

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Start with Milestone 1**: Get the project structure and logging in place first
2. **Template System is Core**: Milestone 2 is critical - many other features depend on it
3. **Use Existing Logger**: The `logger.py` file already exists and should be integrated early
4. **Cross-Platform Early**: Design file paths and UI to be OS-agnostic from the start
5. **Test Templates Thoroughly**: The template engine is the heart of the application
6. **Mock Ollama for Testing**: Don't require actual Ollama installation for unit tests
7. **Security First**: Implement input sanitization and path validation early
8. **Progressive Disclosure**: Keep error messages simple with optional details

### What Wasn't Completed
- No actual code implementation (this was a planning session)
- No project structure creation yet
- No dependency installation
- No git commits made

### Next Steps
1. Review and approve the BUILD-PLAN.md
2. Begin Milestone 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
3. Create the project directory structure
4. Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
5. Integrate the existing logger.py module
