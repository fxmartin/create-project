### Todo Summary
- **Total Tasks Completed**: 2/2 (100%)
- **Completed Tasks**:
  1. ✅ Analyze project specification and requirements for section 1.1
  2. ✅ Generate comprehensive TODO.md for section 1.1 Initialize Project Structure
- **Incomplete Tasks**: None
- **Final Status**: All planned tasks completed successfully

### Key Accomplishments
- Successfully analyzed BUILD-PLAN.md section 1.1 requirements
- Created comprehensive TODO.md with 16 atomic, executable tasks
- Organized tasks into logical categories (Setup, Development, Testing, Documentation)
- Defined clear task sequencing with dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
- Provided detailed implementation notes with code snippets for each task
- Established 8-hour total time estimate for section 1.1 completion

### Features Implemented
- **Task Breakdown System**: Converted high-level BUILD-PLAN.md section into granular tasks
- **Task Categorization**: Organized tasks into Setup (S001-S008), Development (D001-D006), Testing (T001-T002), and Documentation (DOC001-DOC002)
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear prerequisite relationships between tasks
- **Time Estimation**: Realistic time estimates for each atomic task
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable completion criteria for each task
- **Implementation Guidance**: Code snippets and technical notes for developers

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
- **Problem**: Initial session file write was blocked by user
- **Solution**: Adjusted to correct session naming convention with specific focus area
- **Problem**: .current-session file required reading before writing
- **Solution**: Implemented proper read-before-write pattern

### Breaking Changes or Important Findings
- **Project Structure**: Identified need for comprehensive directory structure with 8 main components
- **Python Package Requirements**: Minimum Python 3.9.6 required for both application and generated projects
- **Dependencies**: Project will use uv for package management (not pip/poetry)
- **Testing Strategy**: Requires unit, integration, and GUI testing (no test type can be skipped)
- **Critical Path**: S001 → S002 → D001 → D002 → D006 → T001 → DOC001

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- **No dependencies modified**: This session focused on planning and structure definition
- **Future Dependencies**: PyQt, requests, pyyaml, jinja2 will be added in task 1.2

### Configuration Changes
- **No configuration changes**: Structure planning phase only
- **Future Configuration**: settings.json and .env files to be created in tasks S005 and 1.4

### Deployment Steps Taken
- **No deployment steps**: This was a planning and documentation session
- **Future Deployment**: PyInstaller configuration planned for milestone 7

### Lessons Learned
- **Task Granularity**: Breaking down high-level tasks into 30min-4hr atomic tasks improves execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Proper dependency mapping allows for significant parallel task execution
- **Implementation Notes**: Including code snippets in TODO items reduces developer confusion
- **Testing Integration**: TDD approach requires tests to be planned alongside implementation tasks
- **Documentation Planning**: User and developer documentation should be planned from the start

### What Wasn't Completed
- **No incomplete work**: All planned tasks for this session were completed
- **Future Work**: Actual implementation of the 16 tasks defined in TODO.md

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Start with Setup Tasks**: Complete S001-S008 before moving to development tasks
2. **Use Parallel Execution**: S003-S008 can run in parallel after S002 completion
3. **Follow Python Conventions**: All directories should be proper Python packages with __init__.py
4. **Test Early**: Implement T001-T002 immediately after D006 completion
5. **Maintain Structure**: Use the structure_validator.py to ensure all required directories exist
6. **Follow uv Guidelines**: Use uv for all package management operations
7. **Code Comments**: All files should start with "ABOUTME:" comment lines
8. **Version Control**: Do not use --no-verify when committing code
9. **TDD Practice**: Write tests before implementation code
10. **Task Tracking**: Use TodoWrite tool to track progress through the 16 tasks

### Next Session Recommendations
- Begin with task S001 (Create Root Project Directory Structure)
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress through all 16 tasks
- Commit changes after completing each logical group of tasks
- Run structure validation tests after completing setup tasks
