- Created detailed CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines and workflows
- Updated BUILD-PLAN.md to reflect completion of sections 1.1-1.5
- Troubleshooting guides and quick start documentation

### üöÄ **CI/CD Integration**
- GitHub Actions workflows for testing, linting, and building
- Matrix testing across multiple OS and Python versions
- Automated security scanning and code quality checks
- PyInstaller configuration for executable generation

### ‚öôÔ∏è **IDE Configuration**
- VS Code workspace with proper Python settings
- Debugging configurations and task definitions
- Extension recommendations for optimal development experience
- PyCharm configuration guidance

### üîç **Quality Assurance**
- Pre-commit hooks preventing bad commits
- Automated code formatting with ruff
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with bandit

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Cross-Platform Setup Scripts**
- `scripts/setup-dev.sh` - Unix/Linux/macOS setup
- `scripts/setup-dev.ps1` - Windows PowerShell setup
- Automated Python version checking
- uv package manager installation and configuration
- Virtual environment creation and dependency installation

### 2. **Environment Validation System**
- `scripts/validate-env.py` - Comprehensive environment checker
- Validates Python version, dependencies, project structure
- Checks file permissions and configuration system
- Provides actionable feedback for issues

### 3. **Developer Utilities**
- `scripts/dev-utils.sh` - Common development commands
- Test runners (unit, integration, GUI, coverage)
- Code quality tools (lint, format, typecheck)
- Build and deployment helpers

### 4. **Pre-commit Integration**
- Automated code quality checks on commit
- Ruff linting and formatting
- MyPy type checking
- Security scanning with bandit
- Commit message validation

### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Python version matrix (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Code quality enforcement
- Automated build and release workflows

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### 1. **Configuration Import Issue**
- **Problem:** Validation script couldn't import `get_config` function
- **Cause:** Function wasn't exported in `config/__init__.py`
- **Solution:** Added `get_config`, `get_config_manager`, `get_setting`, `set_setting` to __all__ exports
- **Impact:** Environment validation now works correctly

### 2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- **Problem:** Scripts needed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Solution:** Created separate PowerShell script for Windows, bash script for Unix-like systems
- **Impact:** Seamless setup experience across all platforms

### 3. **Permission Handling**
- **Problem:** Scripts needed executable permissions
- **Solution:** Set proper file permissions and used `chmod +x` in setup
- **Impact:** Scripts run correctly without manual permission changes

## Dependencies Added

### Production Dependencies
- No new production dependencies added

### Development Dependencies
- `pre-commit` - Git hooks for code quality
- Updated `uv.lock` with new dependency resolutions

## Configuration Changes

### 1. **Pre-commit Configuration**
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with comprehensive hooks
- Configured ruff, mypy, bandit, and other quality tools
- Set up conventional commit message validation

### 2. **VS Code Configuration**
- Workspace settings for Python development
- Debugging configurations for the application
- Task definitions for common development operations
- Extension recommendations for optimal experience

### 3. **GitHub Actions Configuration**

- Linting workflow with code quality checks
- Build workflow for releases and executables
- Proper caching for faster CI/CD runs

## Deployment Steps Taken

### 1. **Git Workflow**
- Created feature branch: `feature/development-environment-setup`
- Committed all changes with conventional commit format
- Pushed to remote repository
- Ready for pull request review

### 2. **Environment Validation**
- Tested all setup scripts on current system
- Validated environment checker works correctly
- Verified all utilities function properly
- Confirmed CI/CD workflows are syntactically correct

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Cross-Platform Development**

- PowerShell and Bash have different syntax and capabilities
- Path handling varies between Windows and Unix-like systems

### 2. **Configuration Management**
- Proper export management in Python modules is crucial
- Thread-safe configuration access is important for GUI applications
- Environment variable integration requires careful type conversion

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Automation is key to reducing setup friction
- Clear documentation prevents common setup issues
- Environment validation catches problems early
- IDE configuration greatly improves developer productivity

## Tips for Future Developers

### 1. **Getting Started**
- Use `./scripts/setup-dev.sh` (Unix) or `./scripts/setup-dev.ps1` (Windows)
- Run `./scripts/validate-env.py` to verify setup
- Check `./scripts/dev-utils.sh help` for available commands

### 2. **Development Workflow**
- Use `./scripts/dev-utils.sh quality` before committing
- Pre-commit hooks will catch most issues automatically
- VS Code configuration provides optimal development experience
- Follow conventional commit format for messages

### 3. **Testing**
- Use `./scripts/dev-utils.sh test` for all tests

- CI/CD will run comprehensive tests on all platforms

### 4. **Debugging**
- VS Code debugging configuration is ready to use
- Environment validation script helps diagnose setup issues
- Check logs in `logs/` directory for application issues
- Use `./scripts/dev-utils.sh validate` for environment problems

### 5. **Contributing**
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed guidelines
