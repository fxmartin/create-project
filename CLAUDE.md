# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a PyQt-based GUI application for creating Python project structures. It's a mature, well-architected project with comprehensive testing, modern Python tooling, and professional development practices. The project is currently in Milestone 2 of 7 milestones, with a solid foundation already implemented.

**Key Technologies:**
- Python 3.9.6+ (strict requirement)
- PyQt6 for GUI framework
- uv for fast package management
- Pydantic for data validation
- structlog for advanced logging
- pytest with pytest-qt for testing

## Common Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Initial setup (run once)
./scripts/setup-dev.sh  # macOS/Linux
# OR
./scripts/setup-dev.ps1  # Windows

# Verify environment
uv run python scripts/validate-env.py
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Run the main application
uv run python -m create_project

# Run with debug logging
APP_DEBUG=true uv run python -m create_project
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests (114 tests, all passing)
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=create_project --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
uv run pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests  
uv run pytest tests/gui/           # GUI tests

# Run tests in parallel
uv run pytest -n auto
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Check linting
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check --fix .

# Type checking
uv run mypy create_project/
```

### Build and Package
```bash
# Build PyPI package
uv build

# Build standalone executable
uv run python scripts/build.py
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Configuration System (`create_project/config/`):**
- Thread-safe configuration management with `ConfigManager`
- Pydantic models for type-safe configuration in `models.py`
- Supports JSON files, environment variables, and nested dot notation
- Comprehensive test suite (56 tests) ensuring reliability

**Logging System (`create_project/utils/logger.py`):**
- Structured logging with structlog and colorlog
- File rotation and console output
- Configurable log levels and formats
- Thread-safe operation

**Project Structure:**
```

â”œâ”€â”€ utils/               # âœ… Logging and utilities (complete)
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                # ðŸš§ Business logic (planned)
â”œâ”€â”€ gui/                 # ðŸš§ PyQt interface (planned)

â””â”€â”€ resources/           # ðŸš§ UI assets (planned)
```

### Development Status

**âœ… Completed (Milestone 1):**
- Complete project structure and build system
- Thread-safe configuration management with Pydantic validation
- Advanced logging system with rotation
- Comprehensive test infrastructure (114 tests passing)
- CI/CD workflows and pre-commit hooks
- Cross-platform development environment

**ðŸš§ Current Work (Milestone 2):**
- Template system implementation
- YAML-based project templates
- Input validation system

**ðŸ“‹ Upcoming (Milestones 3-7):**
- Core project generation logic
- PyQt GUI wizard interface
- AI integration via Ollama
- Distribution and packaging

## Testing Requirements

This project maintains **comprehensive test coverage** with strict requirements:

- **Unit Tests**: All business logic must be unit tested
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions must be tested
- **GUI Tests**: PyQt components tested with pytest-qt
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent operations tested
- **Configuration**: All config scenarios covered (26 tests)

**Test Organization:**
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for component interactions
- `tests/gui/` - GUI tests using pytest-qt
- `tests/config/` - Configuration system tests

## Code Style and Standards

### Strict Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.9.6+ (strictly enforced)
- **Type Hints**: All functions must have type hints (mypy strict mode)
- **File Headers**: All files must start with 2-line ABOUTME comments
- **Testing**: TDD approach - write tests before implementation
- **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks enforce ruff formatting and linting

### Code Organization
- Use Pydantic models for all configuration and data validation
- Thread-safe operations for all shared resources
- Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Follow existing patterns in config/ and utils/ directories

## Dependencies and Tools

### Core Dependencies
- PyQt6 >=6.9.1 (GUI framework)
- pydantic >=2.11.7 (data validation)
- structlog >=25.4.0 (structured logging)
- requests >=2.32.4 (HTTP client)
- jinja2 >=3.1.6 (templating)

### Development Tools
- uv (package management - replaces pip/poetry)
- ruff >=0.12.3 (linting and formatting)
- mypy >=1.17.0 (type checking)
- pytest >=8.4.1 (testing)
- pytest-qt >=4.5.0 (GUI testing)
- pre-commit >=4.2.0 (git hooks)

## Important Notes

### Package Management
- **Always use uv**: Never use pip directly
- **Virtual Environment**: Managed automatically by uv
- **Dependencies**: Defined in pyproject.toml, locked in uv.lock

### Configuration
- Settings loaded from `config/settings.json` and `.env`
- Use `ConfigManager` for all configuration access
- Thread-safe operations are critical

### Logging
- Use structured logging via the logger utility
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- Logs rotate automatically based on configuration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Required**: All commits must pass pre-commit hooks
- **Never use**: `--no-verify` flag when committing
- **Includes**: Code formatting, linting, type checking, security scanning

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently working on **Milestone 2: Template System Implementation**. Key areas of focus:

1. **Template Engine**: YAML-based project templates
2. **Validation System**: Input validation and sanitization
3. **License Management**: Comprehensive license repository

When contributing, focus on:
- Following the established patterns in config/ and utils/
- Maintaining comprehensive test coverage
- Using Pydantic models for data validation
- Implementing thread-safe operations
