This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a PyQt-based GUI application for creating Python project structures. It's a mature, well-architected project with comprehensive testing, modern Python tooling, and professional development practices. The project is currently in Milestone 4 of 7 milestones, with a solid enterprise-grade foundation and core engine fully implemented.

**Key Technologies:**
- Python 3.9.6+ (strict requirement)
- PyQt6 for GUI framework
- uv for fast package management
- Pydantic for data validation
- structlog for advanced logging
- pytest with pytest-qt for testing
- httpx for async HTTP requests (Ollama AI integration)
- Jinja2 for template rendering

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Configuration System (`create_project/config/`):**
- Thread-safe configuration management with `ConfigManager`
- Pydantic models for type-safe configuration in `models.py`
- Supports JSON files, environment variables, and nested dot notation
- Comprehensive test suite (56 tests) ensuring reliability
- AI service configuration with Ollama connection settings

**Logging System (`create_project/utils/logger.py`):**
- Structured logging with structlog and colorlog
- File rotation and console output
- Configurable log levels and formats
- Thread-safe operation

## Testing Requirements

This project maintains **comprehensive test coverage** with strict requirements:

- **Unit Tests**: All business logic must be unit tested
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions must be tested
- **GUI Tests**: PyQt components tested with pytest-qt
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent operations tested
- **Configuration**: All config scenarios covered (26 tests)

**Test Organization:**
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for component interactions
- `tests/gui/` - GUI tests using pytest-qt
- `tests/config/` - Configuration system tests
- `tests/ai/` - AI module tests with mock infrastructure

## Code Style and Standards

### Strict Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.9.6+ (strictly enforced)
- **Type Hints**: All functions must have type hints (mypy strict mode)
- **File Headers**: All files must start with 2-line ABOUTME comments
- **Testing**: TDD approach - write tests before implementation
- **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks enforce ruff formatting and linting

### Code Organization
- Use Pydantic models for all configuration and data validation
- Thread-safe operations for all shared resources
- Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Follow existing patterns in config/ and utils/ directories

## Dependencies and Tools

### Core Dependencies
- PyQt6 >=6.9.1 (GUI framework)
- pydantic >=2.11.7 (data validation)

## Important Notes

### Package Management
- **Always use uv**: Never use pip directly
- **Virtual Environment**: Managed automatically by uv
- **Dependencies**: Defined in pyproject.toml, locked in uv.lock

### Configuration
- Settings loaded from `config/settings.json` and `.env`
- Use `ConfigManager` for all configuration access
- Thread-safe operations are critical

### Logging
- Use structured logging via the logger utility
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- Logs rotate automatically based on configuration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Required**: All commits must pass pre-commit hooks
- **Never use**: `--no-verify` flag when committing
- **Includes**: Code formatting, linting, type checking, security scanning

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently working on **Milestone 4: Ollama AI Integration**. Key areas of focus:

1. **Ollama Client**: Auto-detection and HTTP client with retry logic
2. **Caching System**: LRU cache with TTL expiration and JSON persistence
3. **Context Generation**: Error context collection with PII sanitization
4. **AI Service Integration**: Facade pattern with graceful degradation

### Recent Major Achievements (Milestone 3):
- **8 Core Components**: PathHandler, DirectoryCreator, FileRenderer, GitManager, VenvManager, CommandExecutor, ThreadingModel, ProjectGenerator + Public API
- **Security-First Design**: Command whitelisting, path traversal prevention, injection attack protection
- **Enterprise Features**: Atomic operations with rollback, background processing, comprehensive error handling
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility with proper tool detection
- **Test Coverage**: 387 tests passing (100% success rate) with comprehensive scenarios

When contributing, focus on:
- Following the established patterns in config/, core/, and templates/
- Maintaining comprehensive test coverage with TDD approach
- Using Pydantic models for data validation
- Implementing thread-safe operations for GUI compatibility
- Designing for graceful degradation when external services unavailable
