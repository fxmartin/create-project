## Task Sequencing and Dependencies

### Critical Path:
1. S001 → D001 → I001 → T002 (Integration foundation)
2. M5-T005 → T001 (Test coverage improvement)
3. S002 → I002 → T004 (Performance testing)
4. B001, B002 (Bug fixes - can be done in parallel)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities:
- Bug fixes (B001, B002) can be done immediately
- S001 and S002 can be done in parallel
- T003, T004, T005 can be done in parallel after prerequisites
- Documentation tasks can be done alongside testing

### Milestone Completion Criteria:
- [ ] All UI components fully integrated with backend
- [ ] Test coverage >80% achieved
- [ ] All tests passing (no failures)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Integration test suite complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Risk Factors:
1. **Qt Headless Testing**: Many GUI tests skip in CI environment
2. **Async Test Complexity**: AI integration tests have timing issues
3. **Performance Goals**: Need to establish realistic benchmarks
4. **Coverage Target**: Jump from 59% to 80% is significant

### Estimated Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Setup tasks, bug fixes, and integration work
- **Week 2**: Testing tasks and coverage improvement
- **Week 3**: Performance testing, security testing, and documentation

**Total Duration**: 3 weeks (58 hours of focused development)
